NOT ZOMBIES PROTOTYPES README

Hi there! If you're reading this, you've successfully navigated
yourself to the Not Zombies protoype directory. Great work! From
here, you can easily find your way to a version of our game
that will work on your system. You can see that there are four
wonderful options to choose from. Let me explain them!

	- NZ_LNX_V1: The first, universal (meaning both x86 and x64
	processor architectures are supported) Linux version of our game

	- NX_OSX_V1: The first, universal OSX version of our game

	- NZ_x86_V1: The first x86 Windows version of our game

	- NZ_x86-64_V1: The first x64 Windows version of our game

If you need a TL;DR for this, you should ONLY use the directories
with processor architectures in the names if you have a WINDOWS
machine. Any other distro and you're in the clear by using the
obvious abbreviation of the OS.

Thanks, and enjoy the first version of NOT ZOMBIES!
