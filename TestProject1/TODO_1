TODO: Write transitions between scenes. The game ought to be able to use the road as a transitionary / spawn locator between maps. We can try setting end points between the sub-regions denoted by the areas on the map and connect those by transitioning between scenes. 

Should also figure out if we want to preserve enemy locations / item locations when transitioning to a new scene or just create a new iteration and new generation points.
